# Simple-game.-Alien-invasion

User rules a rocket which appears in the bottom of the screen in the beginning of the game. 

Gamer can move the rocket to the left and to the right with arrows, or shoot with Space.

Since the game has begun, aliens' fleet appears and starts moving downward the screen. 

The gamer shoots and kills aliens.

If the user has killed all aliens, a new fleet appears. It moves faster than the previous fleet.

When at least one alien touches the rocket or reaches the bottom of the screen, the gamer loses the rocket.

If the user loses three rockets -- game over.
